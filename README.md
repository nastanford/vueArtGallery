# Vue Art Gallery 
### Vue.js, ColdFusion
This is a simple Vue Application that currently is calling a ColdFusion CFC to a database that gets installed when setting up a ColdFusion Server called CFArtGallery. This is not using a node-modules folder just the Vue.js file.

* VueJS
* ColdFusion CFC
* Bootstrap
* jQuery (not needed but for future changes.)
